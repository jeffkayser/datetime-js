# datetime-js

## What is it

A datetime library I began one day after vanilla Javascript datetime frustrations. Incomplete, alpha-quality project, but highly usable if you just need to do some run-of-the-mill datetime manipulation.

## How to use it

Place the following in your HTML <head> section:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="datetime.js"></script>
